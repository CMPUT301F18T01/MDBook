## Project Part 4 -- Half-Way Prototype
### Learning Objectives
* Develop a usable, interactive application using Java and Android.
* Create programming interface documentation.
* Apply test-driven development.
### Overview
This project part focuses on a working prototype with about half of the requirements. You must have at least some server connectivity working by this part.

### Deliverables
1. **Addressing Feedback**:  
   Address any TA feedback on the previous project part.

2. **Code Base of Prototype**:  
   Your system will be demonstrated in the lab and its source code will be inspected. The code should conform to some consistent coding convention. At this point, your prototype should be implemented to provide something tangible to the user, supporting about half the requirements. Deliver the source code to your source repository.

   The code base must be synchronized with the test cases and the requirements spec and the UML diagrams.

3. **Code Documentation**:  
   For each source code file, you should have a brief introductory comment describing its purpose or role within the application or a design pattern, as well as any currently outstanding issues. Provide Javadoc interface documentation for your model classes and their public methods (at least). Deliver the generated Javadoc documentation to your source repository.

4. **Test Cases**:  
    Provide unit tests for your model classes. Provide intent tests for the use cases you support. Deliver the test code to your source repository. If you have test data files, also include those. Test data should be realistic.

5. **Object-Oriented Design**:  
   Update your object-oriented design using a UML class diagram (or diagrams), including detail on key attributes and methods. Include notes on the use of design patterns among the classes. The diagram(s) may be reverse engineered from the code, but must be edited, arranged, and selective (not a raw dump). The diagram(s) must be neat and tidy, and drawn well using computer tools and embedded as image(s) in your team wiki. The diagram(s) will likely evolve.

6. **Release Planning**:  
   Plan the major use cases and user stories that need to be done for project part 5. This plan will likely evolve and should be maintained up-to-date in your team wiki. It should be clear from the plan the progress towards satisfying all the specified requirements.

7. **Reuse Statement**:  
   Document instances of software reuse. Give proper credit to the original developers. Obtain approval for the use of third-party libraries as appropriate. Enter this information in your team wiki.

The evaluation of this project part will also include a component called "relative quality". This is used to differentiate projects that meet the minimum from projects that go "the extra mile".

### Restrictions
Use Java, with Android, and Elasticsearch.

### Hints
Integrate early and often, even if some parts may have to be stubbed out to return canned data. Think about issues like offline behavior and server connectivity early in the design, rather than trying to retrofit them later.

### Submission Procedure
Use wiki and your source repository.

Please make sure your repository has the right version of code by the deadline. The TA will try to build your program from the submitted code. The TA may contact you if there are build issues.

During your team's assigned lab section in the week of the due date (or possibly at a mutually arranged time), you must demo your working prototype to your TA mentor. All team members have to attend the demo.

### Individual Task and Peer Review Form
Each member must complete an assessment form to describe his or her individual contribution to the project for this stage, and to review the performance of the other members.
